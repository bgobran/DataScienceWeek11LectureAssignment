# DataScienceWeek11LectureAssignment

This repository contains all my files for the Week 11 Lecture Assignment for SMU's Doing Data Science course in the Fall of 2016.

This study involved looking at time series data.  While we were assigned one of three files, I choose to repeat the steps for all three files.
